# Stellar Classification - Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17

This repository contains my implementation of three machine learning models presented in "Qi, Zhuliang. (2022). Stellar Classification by Machine Learning. SHS Web of Conferences. 144. 03006. 10.1051/shsconf/202214403006.".

## Context

The paper suggested three different algorithms for model training: decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine.

# Stellar Classification - Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17

This repository contains my implementation of three machine learning models presented in "Qi, Zhuliang. (2022). Stellar Classification by Machine Learning. SHS Web of Conferences. 144. 03006. 10.1051/shsconf/202214403006.".

## Context

As sky survey systems become increasingly powerful and efficient, the amount of data they generate also grows exponentially. Sifting through all the raw measurements and trying to make sense of it all manually is nothing short of an impossible task.  

The paper suggested three different algorithms for model training: decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine.
